Hi, I'm Changi! So happy to have you here.

I am a Software Engineer at <a href='https://semiconductor.samsung.com/about-us/business-area/system-lsi/'>Samsung Electronics</a>, where I work on audio solutions within the System LSI business. My research interests focus on how machines can better perceive the world through multimodal understanding, including audio and visual signals, to enrich human life.

Prior to joining Samsung, I completed research internships at the <a href='https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en'>Max Planck Institute</a> and <a href='https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri'>ETRI</a>, and earned B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Kyungpook National University in South Korea, where I worked on image and signal processing research.

Apart from work, I enjoy [doodling](/personal/#drawing), boxing, and traveling.
